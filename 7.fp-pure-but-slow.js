/*
In this version of the program, we extend the concept of "pure"
even further as an exercise. A pure expression is an expression that has
no side effects. This program is based-on program 6, and it
maximizes the amount of code written in this "pure" form. With the
exception of 4 lines, every line in this program is a pure expression.
Moreover, almost the entire program has been written as one big
pure function: program.

Two of the support functions: sorted and merge - although have the
property of being pure functions, each contain non-pure expressions
within them. These were practically necessary due to limitations
of JavaScript.

This program also rewrites the display code in program 6, and now
represents it as a pure function which takes the top 10 results
and returns a string to be displayed.

However, this approach has resulted in one problem: the
program is now dog slow. See comments in the tallyUp function.
