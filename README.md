# Word Count (Top 10)

This repo contains implementations of the same program but in different programming styles, including *imperative*, *object-oriented programming*, and *functional programming*. It is intended to be a teaching tool for people starting to learn about functional programming - to get concrete examples of how fp compares to other existing styles.

The way to read this repo is to read each `.js` in order - the files are numbered. The code itself has ample comments.

## To Run

If you want to run these examples, you need Node.js version 5.0+.

```
git clone https://github.com/airportyh/word-count.git
cd word-count
npm install
```

To run one of the files, simply type `node <name of the file>`, for example:

```
node 1.imperative.js
```
